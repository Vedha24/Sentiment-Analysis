# ðŸ§  Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning

This project applies deep learning techniques to perform sentiment analysis on text data (e.g., tweets). The objective is to classify text as expressing **positive** or **negative** sentiment using neural network architectures like **MLP**, **CNN**, and **Autoencoders**.

It walks through the complete pipeline â€” from data preprocessing and model development to training, evaluation, and visualization.
